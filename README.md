1) The first error I resolved is that start command in package.json the start script I removed browser=none

2) I setup the filters for All,Active and Completed Tasks.

3) Now Users can create multiple lists by clicking on any list a user can make as many as he wants.He can also make the main lists also.

4) I setup the redux thunk and reducers for the redux implementation of global state management.
